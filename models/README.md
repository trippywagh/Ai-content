# 3D Models Directory

## Adding Your 3D Model

1. **Place your .glb file here** with the name `dabba-model.glb`
2. **Supported formats**: .glb, .gltf (recommended: .glb for single file)
3. **File size**: Keep under 10MB for optimal web performance

## Current Setup

The app is configured to load `dabba-model.glb` from this directory.

## Features

Your 3D model will have:
- ✅ **Interactive rotation** (drag to rotate)
- ✅ **Zoom in/out** (scroll wheel)
- ✅ **Auto-rotation** (stops on user interaction)
- ✅ **Professional lighting** (ambient + directional + point lights)
- ✅ **Shadows** (realistic depth)
- ✅ **Responsive** (adapts to screen size)
- ✅ **Touch support** (mobile-friendly)

## Model Requirements

For best results, ensure your model:
- Is centered at origin (0,0,0)
- Has reasonable scale (not too large/small)
- Includes materials/textures if desired
- Is optimized for web (reduced polygon count if possible)

## Troubleshooting

If the model doesn't load:
1. Check file path: `models/dabba-model.glb`
2. Verify file format is .glb
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Ensure file size is reasonable (< 10MB)
